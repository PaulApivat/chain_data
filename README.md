# chain_data

Exploring blockchain data and analytics.

## Motivation

The primary purpose of this project is to explore onchain data in various crypto projects. This includes: Ethereum, projects built on Ethereum, notably DeFi, NFTs, DAOs. I'd also like to explore onchain data for Bitcoin. The goal is to learn about tools (SQL, GraphQL), common metrics and create dashboard(s).

I'd like to start the exploration with [Dune Analytics](https://duneanalytics.com/home). This is a perfect opportunity to deepen my skills for all things SQL.

I'd also like to explore [The Graph Protocol](https://thegraph.com/), specifically what the Curator and Indexer roles entail.

Other Projects to explore:

- Etherscan
- CoinMetrics [Community Network Data](https://coinmetrics.io/community-network-data/)
- GlassNode [Metric](https://glassnode.com/metrics#tier-1) & [Glassnode Academy](https://academy.glassnode.com/indicators/coin-issuance/puell-multiple)
- [Bitcoin Energy Usage](https://www.bitcoinwillnotboiltheocean.com/) data
- Projects in the Data/Analytics section of this [graphic](https://twitter.com/n2ckchong/status/1373533273398243328/photo/1)

### Potential Outcomes

1. A SQL primer for explore Ethereum on Dune Analytics. [Tool]
2. A GraphQL primer for TheGraph explorer. [Tool]
3. Top 10 Projects in DeFi, by the numbers in both SQL and GraphQL. [Dashboard]
4. Top 10 Metrics investors use to evaluate DeFi projects [Metrics]
