# chain_data

Exploring blockchain data and analytics.

## Motivation

The primary purpose of this project is to explore onchain data for various crypto projects (Ethereum & Bitcoin). In the process, we'll learn tools (SQL, GraphQL), common metrics and create dashboard(s).

### Phase 1

We'll start with [Dune Analytics](https://duneanalytics.com/home); a perfect opportunity to deepen SQL skills.

Then, we'll also do [The Graph Protocol](https://thegraph.com/). We'll start with GraphQL to create sub-graphs. Then we'll query our own sub-graph.

_Note_: Also join discord for these projects.

### Phase 1 Outcomes

1. A SQL primer to explore Ethereum on Dune Analytics. [Tool]
2. A GraphQL primer to create sub-graphs. [Tool]
3. Top 10 Projects in DeFi, by the numbers in both SQL and GraphQL. [Dashboard]
4. Top 10 Metrics investors use to evaluate DeFi projects [Metrics] [Queries]
