# chain_data

Exploring blockchain data and analytics.

## Motivation

The primary purpose of this project is to explore onchain data for various crypto projects (Ethereum & Bitcoin). In the process, we'll learn tools (SQL, GraphQL), common metrics and create dashboard(s).

### Phase 1: Dune Analytics

We'll start with [Dune Analytics](https://duneanalytics.com/home); a perfect opportunity to deepen SQL skills. We will:

- write explainer for 5 useful dashboards to know
- [Introductory Ethereum Metrics](https://duneanalytics.com/kroeger0x/ethereum-metrics_1), see Charts from the Ethereum Network ([link](https://etherchain.org/charts)), Network Statistics ([link](https://ethstats.io/))

- [BAT Token](https://duneanalytics.com/queries/27776): Support essay demonstrating BAT as a Web3 browser. Query BAT Token to demonstrate supply & demand

- [DEX metrics](https://duneanalytics.com/hagaetc/dex-metrics)
- [BTC on Ethereum](https://duneanalytics.com/eliasimos/btc-on-ethereum_1)
- [Uniswap Fundamentals](https://duneanalytics.com/carrawu/uniswap-analytics)
- [Uniswap Governance](https://duneanalytics.com/lsquared/uniswap-governance)
- [Tornado Cash, Privacy on Ethereum](https://duneanalytics.com/poma/tornado-cash_1)
- [Lending, Compound MakerDAO Aave](https://duneanalytics.com/hagaetc/lending)

- Dashboards the need updating:
- [DeFi Pulse](https://duneanalytics.com/RasterlyRock/defi-weekly-pulse)

- Projects on Dune:
- [Compound](https://duneanalytics.com/projects/compound)
- [Aave](https://duneanalytics.com/projects/aave)

- write an explainer for the Top SQL 10 Queries you found.

Then, we'll also do [The Graph Protocol](https://thegraph.com/). We'll start with GraphQL to create sub-graphs. Then we'll query our own sub-graph.

_Note_: Also join discord for these projects.

### Phase 1 Outcomes

1. A SQL primer to explore Ethereum on Dune Analytics. [Tool]
2. Top 10 Projects in DeFi, by the numbers in both SQL and GraphQL. Build a [Dashboard]
   2a. See if possible to do a [rabbithole quest](https://rabbithole.gg/quests) on any coins.
3. Top 10 Metrics investors use to evaluate DeFi projects [Metrics] [Queries]
4. Join community
5. Reflections on phase 1 (falling down the rabbit hole yet?)

### Phase 2 The Graph Protocol

Start with the Graph Explorer:

Then explore The Graph Documentation:

- Define a Subgraph
- Deploy a Subgraph
- Query The Graph
- GraphQL API
- join community

### Phase 2 Outcomes

1. Write a primer on The Graph [Documentation](https://thegraph.com/docs/introduction)
2. A GraphQL primer to create sub-graphs. [Tool]
3. Top 10 Projects in DeFi, by the numbers in both SQL and GraphQL. [Dashboard]
4. Join community
5. Reflections on phase 2 (falling down the rabbit hole yet?)
